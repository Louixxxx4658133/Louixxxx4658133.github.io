   <p class="entre-p">At the root of every success there is some form of well-husbanded and well￾directed energy. There has been some persistent brooding of the mind upon
a project.</p>
   
   <p class="entre-p"> Success is like a flower: it may appear more or less suddenly, but
it is the finished product of a long series of efforts, of preparatory stages.
Men see the success, but the preparation for it, the innumerable mental
processes that led up to it,</p>
   
   <p class="entre-p"> are hidden from them.
Without exertion nothing can be accomplished.
In order to achieve the higher forms of success, a man must give up anxiety,
hurry, and fussiness.</p>

June Twenty-seventh.
PRESSING forward persistently along a given way is sure to lead to a
     destination that</p>
   
 <p class="entre-p"> is definitely associated with that way. Frequent going aside,
or turning back, will render effort fruitless; no destination will he reached;
success will remain afar off.
</p>
   
   <p class="entre-p">
Effort, and the more effort, and then effort again, is the keynote of success.
     As the simple old saying has it:</p>
   
 <p id="quote">
     <em>If at first you don’t succeed, Try again.</em> All the precepts of successful
business men are precepts of doing; all the precepts of the wise teachers are
precepts of doing. To cease to do is to cease to be of any use in the economy
of life. Doing means effort, exertion.
Transmute the energy that wears and breaks down into that deeper and less
obtrusive kind that preserves and builds up.
The silent, calm people will manifest a more enduring form of success than
those who are noisy and restless</p>
